    <h3> Places Visited: </h3>
    <p>Circus Circus is a resort and casino. With my cousins, I went to the Adventuredome, where we went on many rides. There was also a circus show which we watched. To top it off, there were many good food places to choose from.</p>

    <p>The Sphere is a round spherical building with advanced technology. We saw AI robots that people can talk to. Then, we went into the theater and watched a short film called "PostCard from Earth." It was a very interactive and fun experience.</p>

    <p>The Dancing Fountains at the Bellagio resort is a wonderful attraction to see at night. Every 15 minutes, there is a 6 minute show where the water dances to a random song everytime. Lots of people gather and watch the graceful moves of the water at night.</p>
